# Anastasis Moraitis | Full-Stack Web Developer

## 👨‍💻 About Me
Full-stack web developer with a passion for building secure, innovative applications. My focus areas include web security, artificial intelligence integration, and creating responsive, user-friendly interfaces. I enjoy tackling complex problems and constantly expanding my technical toolkit.

## 🔭 Current Project
Currently working on [Anomaly-Detector](https://github.com/anastasis-mor/Anomaly-Detector-Display) - An application designed to identify unusual patterns and potential security threats in data streams.
This project integrates with existing web applications to provide real-time security monitoring and threat detection.

🔒 Project Overview
The Anomaly-Detector works as a security layer that:

Monitors user behavior patterns across web applications
Identifies suspicious activities and potential security breaches
Provides real-time alerts and detailed threat analytics
Integrates seamlessly with existing authentication systems


🚧 Under Construction: This project is actively being developed with new features and improvements added regularly. While the core functionality is operational, I'm currently expanding the integration capabilities.

Note: This project is maintained as a private repository for security purposes. The images show a demonstration version with non-sensitive data.
